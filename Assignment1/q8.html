            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first paragraph. It is indented using multiple non-breaking spaces 
            (&nbsp;) to create a visual indentation. This technique ensures consistent spacing in the paragraph 
            regardless of the device or browser used.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second paragraph.&nbsp; Like the first, it is indented with non-breaking 
            spaces.&nbsp; This method is helpful when you need to create simple formatting without relying on external 
            styles or CSS.
